    "--> with a number of pieces **number_Of_Pieces**\n",
    "\n",
    "A *piece* is a part of the matrix that is named by a number (eg piece 5 will be defined by all the location in a 3d matrix where the number 5 can be found). As in real 3d puzzle a piece is continuous, this means that the location that defines the piece are adjacent to each others along 1 axis (see the example picture for better visual understanding).\n",
    "The *size of the piece* is the number of location taken by this piece in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 0 : To do that the algortihm select number_Of_Pieces locations in a 3d matrix filled with 0 and write the number of the piece in the matrix. (For 7 pieces there will be 7 locations in the matrix that won't be 0 and be 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 7; these numbers are the \"name of the pieces\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1:\n",
    "While there is still 0 in the 3d matrix :\n",
    "    Do : Then at each step the algorithm tries to extend the piece to another adjacent location that is not selected yet (with a probability of success).\n",
    "                If there is at least 1 free location and if the extend is a success then the number of the piece will replace the 0 that was written in the free location\n",
    "Step 2: Once the expansion of the pieces is over the function check_stat calculate statistics properties of the generated 3d puzzle. If the statitics meets requirement then the puzzle is validated, else the algorithm goes back to Step 0."
